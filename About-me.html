            <p>So...hi, i'm Jokki and yes, you find my little space on the <span class="rainbow">internet </span></p>
            <p>How to start... i'm just a random dude that likes watching movies and shows,listen to music, play video games and drawing, those are my hobbies :D.</p>
            <p> I also like programming a little, not a big fan of super optimize and competitive programming, just "<span class="rainbow">fun</span>" programming, but i'm also aware that i need to improve on my code, and that's the reason for this website</p>
            <p>The way i found this type of websites was just my curiosity in "mysterious" places on the internet, which make me do this, taking A LOT of inspiration from those websites, plus i also met some cool people on the way that help me on getting tools and assets for this place</p>
            <p>But that's to much for now, let's talk about other things</p>

                <h2>Favorite movie</h2>
                <p>
                    My favorite movie is BladeRunner. Which one do you ask? BOTH the original and the sequel. Why both and not just choose one? The two make a great saga and in my opinion they complement each other (of course, but i kinda like 2049 a lit more... just a little bit)
                    </p>

                    <p>Just a freaking cool looking poster, i need it in my room</p>
                    <p>I always been a fan of cyberpunk esthetics, but since i watched does movies everything felt much more "unic"</p>
                    <p>It made me connect more with the roots of the genre, see all the references, appreciate the scenes, make me feel the world, and i loved it</p>

                <h1>Favorite shows</h1>
                <p>If you were looking around this website you can see a clearly thematic, which is Serial experiment <a href="lain.html">Lain</a>, and as you can tell already, i really like it</p>
                <p>But also Cowboy bebop is a show that i love so much, i still can feel the emptiness that the show let me</p>
                <p>I can't recommend so much Cowboy bebop, just watch it</p>

                    <h2>My favorite games</h2>
                    <p>At last we are here, my favorite sagas are Persona and Half life, and i could talk about those games but my favorite game is... Hotel dusk room 215 for the nintendo ds, in fact, if you have the music on, it is from that game</p>
                    <p>This game show me what games could be, the cool history, the amazing art style, everything is so special to me. It take me back when i was a kid playing on my Ds in summer, and i really love it</p>
                    <img class="imgAjust" src="Images/Kyle.webp">
                    <p>Sadly the studio who make the game closed years ago, but at least there is a secuel called "Last window the secret of cape west"</p>
                    <p>The creators are the same than Another Code,and they recently released a remake of that game and its sequel, so there is still hope for Hotel Dusk, i hope... </p>
