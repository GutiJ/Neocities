            <p>So...hi, i'm Jokki and yes, you find my little space on the <span class="rainbow">internet </span></p>
            <p>How to start... i'm just a random dude that likes watching movies and shows,listen to music, play video games and drawing, those are my hobbies :D.</p>
            <p> I also like programming a little, not a big fan of super optimize and competitive programming, just "<span class="rainbow">fun</span>" programming, but i'm also aware that i need to improve on my code, and that's the reason for this website</p>
            <p>The way i found this type of websites was just my curiosity in "mysterious" places on the internet, which make me do this, taking A LOT of inspiration from those websites, plus i also met some cool people on the way that help me on getting tools and assets for this place</p>
            <p>But that's to much for now, let's talk about other things</p>

                <h2>Favorite movie</h2>
                <p>
                    My favorite movie is BladeRunner. Which one do you ask? BOTH the original and the sequel. Why both and not just choose one? The two make a great saga and in my opinion they complement each other (of course, but i kinda like 2049 a lit more... just a little bit)
